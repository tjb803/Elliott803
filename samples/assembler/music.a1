* This forces the console speaker to produce something that 
* approximates to a simple tune!

* Sound something like the required note for the required duration.
* Note that the first instruction here gets patched so the value 
* for the 55 opcode is 6 less than the note freq value - to account for
* the time spent outside the 55 instruction.

* These are note definitions to produce approximate tones from the C major 
* scale (plus a B-flat).  Value is the number of 288us cycles for frequency.  
* This is rather approximate!           * Note Freq  Cycles

* These are the timings for whole notes, half notes and quarter notes in
* number of 288us cycles.  So 3500 is approximately 1 second.

* value.  A zero marks the end.
