Elliott 803 Simulation - Bug fixes and known bugs
=================================================

v0.5.0, v0.6.0
--------------
  First releases
    
v0.7.0
------
  Improvements:
    - Manual Data button added to console - will cause a wait for the Operate
      bar to be pressed when a 70 0 instruction is issued.
    - Simulator can be started with a 'machine image' file to restore a 
      previous state
         - note: 'machine image' can be a core dump and currently only
                 the contents of the store will be restored.   
         - a pre-loaded Algol image is provided   
    - Teletype 'Save' button will save all existing output as well as any new
      output   
    - Icon image files added to package           
  
  Main bug fixes:
    - Read and Obey buttons enter step-by-step mode when pressed
	- Obey function (press Operate with Obey selected) correctly single steps 
	  single instructions
	- Overflow detection corrected for some double length arithmetic functions
	- Floating point overflow now stops and waits for Operate bar before 
	  continuing (with undefined results)
	- Floating point 'divide-by-zero' sets arithmetic overflow as well as floating
	  point overflow  
	- Teletype window resizes correctly    
	
v1.0.0
------
  This version contains all the function I had originally intended to 
  implement.  There is plenty more that could be done (see features.txt),
  but I now think this is ready to be called v1.0.0.

  Improvements:
    - Increase speed considerably when CPU and/or Store view is minimized
    - Add Paper Tape Station view allowing swapping of readers and punches
    - Add plotter device and Plotter output view
    - Support full save and restore of machine images including the core 
      store contents and all window positions and layout
    - Improve appearance when using Nimbus look-and-feel
    
v1.1.0
------
  Improvements:
    - Add correct instruction and device I/O timings
    - Add 'control' window to set real-time mode and display CPU speed    
    - Remove Paper Tape Station view (it wasn't very useful)
    - Add a 'cursor' to the teletype to show the print head position 
    
v1.2.0
------
  Improvements:
    - Add loudspeaker output for authentic 803 sounds     
    - Rework the console window to look more like the real thing
