  First releases
    
v0.7.0
------
  Improvements:
    - Manual Data button added to console - will cause a wait for the Operate
      bar to be pressed when a 70 0 instruction is issued.
    - Simulator can be started with a 'machine image' file to restore a 
      previous state
         - note: 'machine image' can be a core dump and currently only
                 the contents of the store will be restored.   
         - a pre-loaded Algol image is provided   
    - Teletype 'Save' button will save all existing output as well as any new
      output
