<h1>Quick Start</h1>
<p>This is a quick overview of how to run a simple program using the simulator.
There is a lot more detail in the <a href="operation.html">Operation Guide</a>.</p>
<p>In this example we'll just run a small program that prints a short mesage
on the output teletype.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>If you haven't already done so install the simulator and the related sample
programs and documentation by unzipping the rumtime package into a 
subdirectory on your machine.
Make sure you have Java 5 (or later) installed and working - try typing the 
command &quot;<kbd>java -version</kbd>&quot; at a terminal or command prompt 
if you are not sure.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Start Up</h2>
To start the simulator enter the following command at a terminal or command
prompt:
<blockquote><pre>
<code>java -jar elliott803-n.n.n.jar</code>
</pre></blockquote>    
<p>on some systems (such as Windows) you should also be able to double-click
on the JAR file to to launch the application.</p>
<p>The simulator should start and display a window containing several smaller
windows something like this:</p>
<table frame="void" rules="none">
<tr>
<td valign="middle" width="100"><b>Top left is the operator's console</b></td>
<td rowspan="3"><img src="image/qs1.jpg" alt="Main Frame"/></td>
<td align="right" valign="middle" width="100"><b>Top right is a view of the
workings of the CPU and Storage</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><br><br><br></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="middle" width="100"><b>Bottom left is the teletype output</b></td>
<td align="right" valign="middle" width="100"><b>Bottom right are the paper tape 
readers and punches</b></td>
</tr> 
</table>
<hr>
<h2>Loading and Running a Program</h2>
<p>Programs are loaded from paper tape.
The program tape needs to be loaded into Reader 1, so hit the &quot;Load...&quot; 
button on the small window marked <b>Reader 1</b> and use the file selection dialog 
to choose a tape to load.
Navigate to the <var>tapes / samples</var> directory and select the tape 
called <var>hello1.tape</var>.
Leave the <i>Tape Format</i> option on the right of the dialog set to the default 
value of <i>Auto</i>.</p>
<p>To get a tape to load you use a small program called the <i>Initial Instructions</i>
that is hard-wired into the machine in storage locations 0 to 3.
This is a bootstrap program that can read a binary coded tape from the tape reader
and load it into store at a specific address.
If the binary tape is suitably encoded the initial instructions can also cause 
a jump to the program entry point when the end of the tape is reached.</p>
<p>The operator console is used to make the computer run the initial instructions
by forcing a jump to location 0 where the initial instruction program starts.
To make a jump the large number of buttons on the left of the console are used 
to create a machine instruction, the computer is them told to read and execute that
instructions.</p>
<p>The 39 buttons on the left of the console are called the <i>Word Generator</i>, there
is one button per bit of a complete machine word.
A machine word can hold two full instructions, each instruction being represented as 
a two (octal) digit op-code (6 bits) and an address from 0 to 8191 (13 bits).
Two instructions therefore need 38 bits and that leaves one special bit (known as 
the <i>B digit</i>) that sits between the two.</p>
<p>Pressing just the single top left most &quot;4&quot; button (as shown in the 
red circle below) creates a pair of instructions that would be written as 
<b>40&nbsp;0&nbsp;:&nbsp;00&nbsp;0</b>.
The first instruction has a <b>40</b> op-code which is a jump and the target address 
is <b>0</b>.
The second instruction has a <b>00</b> op-code which is a no-op, but it doesn't really
matter as it will not get executed.</p>
<center><img src="image/qs2.jpg" alt="Console"/></center>   
<p>To execute this instruction to cause a jump to the initial instructions which will 
then load the program in the tape reader, we use the operation buttons at the bottom right 
(as shown in green above).</p>
<p>First ensure the <i>Read</i> button is selected and then press the <i>Operate</i>
key.
This reads the instruction on the word generator into the CPU ready to be run.</p>
<p>Next select the <i>Normal</i> button and again press the <i>Operate</i> key.
This sets the CPU running normally and it executes instructions starting with
the one we just loaded.
We therefore do a jump to location zero and the hard-wired initial instructions 
take over.
These read the tape, load the program into store and jump to its entry point.</p>
<p>If all is correct you should see a message printed to the output teletype.</p>
<center><img src="image/optele.jpg" alt="Teletype"/></center>
<p>If you want to run the program again, you should first press the <i>Reset</i>
key on the console, reload the program tape in the reader and re-execute the 
<b>40&nbsp;0</b> instruction - assuming the word generator buttons are still correct 
just select the sequence <i>Read</i>, <i>Operate</i>, <i>Normal</i>, <i>Operate</i> again.</p>
<p>Of course, since the program remains in store you don't really need to load it from
tape again to re-run it, you could just execute a jump to the program entry point
rather than a jump to location zero.
