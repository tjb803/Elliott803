</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="gui">Interactive Graphical Interface</h2>
<p>The graphical interface can be started by running the simulator JAR file or by
running the <code>elliott803.Main</code> program within the JAR.</p>
<h3>Command</h3>
<blockquote><pre>
   <code>java -jar elliott803-n.n.n.jar [options] [machine]</code> 
or <code>java <b>elliott803.Main</b> [options] [machine]</code>
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<blockquote><dl>
<dt><code>machine</code></dt><dd>A previously saved machine image.</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<h4>Options</h4>
<blockquote><dl>
<dt><code>-volume <i>volume</i></code></dt>
<dd>The initial loudspeaker volume.
This should be a number from 0 to 10, a value of 0 will switch the 
sound emulation off (which can be useful on slower machines).
If not specified the default value is 5.</dd>
<dt><code>-look <i>lookandfeel</i></code></dt>
<dd>The name of the Java look-and-feel to use.
By default the standard platform look-and-feel will be used.
Other look-and-feels that may be available (depending on operating system
and Java version) include: <code>metal</code>, <code>ocean</code>, <code>steel</code>,
<code>windows</code>, <code>classic</code>, <code>motif</code>, <code>gtk</code>,
<code>mac</code> and <code>nimbus</code>.
</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>The graphical interface displays a main window containing several smaller 
internal windows representing the various hardware and devices that form the 
Elliott 803 simulation.
These windows can be moved around and resized (or minimized) as required.
The current layout can be saved as part of a machine image and restored 
in a later run.</p>
<p>Most interaction will take place with the paper tape reader and tape punch
devices and with the system operator's console.</p>
<h3 id="start">Start Up and Shut Down</h3>
<p>When the simulator starts up it can load a pre-saved machine image containing
the complete core memory contents and the size, position any layout of all
the application windows.
This image can either be provided as a parameter when starting the application
or can be loaded later.
If no image is provided a default window layout will be used. 
<br clear="left">
<h3 id="opsim">The Simulation Control Window</h3>
<img src="image/opsim.jpg" alt="Simulator Control" align="left"/>
<p>The simulation control window provides functions not present on a real 
803 that are used to perform additional control of the simulation.
The two additional functions provided are for controlling the simulation speed
and for loading and saving machine images.
<br clear="left">
<h4 id="speed">Controlling the Simulation Speed</h4>
<img src="image/cpuspd.jpg" alt="RealTime" align="left">
<p>The <i>CPU Speed</i> section is used to control and display the simulated
CPU speed.
The speed can be set to <i>Real time</i> which should run at a very close 
approximation to the speed of a real 803B or, if the checkbox is cleared, it
can be set to run as fast as the implementation will allow.
Note that sound can only be produced when the speed is set to real time.</p>
<p>The CPU speed number displays the current simulation speed in relation 
to  real machine - so <b>1.0</b> means it is running at the same speed 
as a real machine (which should be the case when the <i>Real time</i> option 
is selected) and values greater than 1 indicate running faster than a real
machine.
<br clear="left">
<h4 id="image">Loading and Saving Machine Images</h4>
<img src="image/lsimg.jpg" alt="LoadSave" align="left">
<p>The <i>Machine Image</i> section is used to save the current machine image 
or restore a previously saved machine image.
A machine image consists of the complete core memory and may also include the 
size, position and layout of all the windows on the screen.
They are typically saved as files with an extension of 
&quot;<code>.803</code>&quot;.</p>
<br clear="left">
<h3 id="opcon">The Operator Console</h3>
<img src="image/opcon.jpg" alt="Operator Console" align="left"/>
<p>The operator console is the mechanism by which the computer is operated.
There are 39 buttons on the left hand side called the <i>Word Generator</i>.
These buttons are used to form complete machine words, typically instructions.
For convenience the value of the instruction currently formed by the buttons on
the word generator is shown at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When one of these 39 buttons is pressed it will stay pressed down.
You can release the button, and all other buttons in the same group, by pressing 
the red release button (marked with an <i>R</i>) at the far left of the row.</p>
<p>On the right hand side are the various operation buttons and indicator lights.
The <i>Clear Store</i> button sets all storage locations to zero.  
The <i>Reset</i> button stops any current execution, clears any &quot;busy&quot; 
condition and returns control to the console.</p>
<p>The three buttons marked <i>Read</i>, <i>Normal</i> and <i>Obey</i> are used
in conjunction with the <i>Operate</i> bar to operate the computer.
To use them you first select the function required by pressing one of the three
buttons then hit the <i>Operate</i> bar to execute it.</p>
<p>The <i>Read</i> function reads the instruction currently set on the word
generator buttons to the CPU instruction register, ready to be executed.
The <i>Obey</i> function obeys the next instruction then returns to step-by-step
mode.
The <i>Normal</i> function obeys the next instruction and continues executing
instructions normally.</p>
<p id="boot">So a typical sequence of operations to cause a jump to the 
<a href="#initins">initial instructions</a> at location zero (to load a program 
from the tape reader) would be:</p>
<ul compact>
<li>Set the instruction <b>40 0 : 00 0</b> on the word generator (this just needs
the top left-most button pressed).</li>
<li>Select <i>Read</i>, <i>Operate</i> to load up that <b>40 0</b> instruction
ready to be run.</li>
<li>Select <i>Normal</i>, <i>Operate</i> to run the jump instruction and to continue
running normally.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Manual Data</i> is used to cause the system to wait (until the <i>Operate</i>
bar is pressed) whenever an instruction to read the word generator is executed.
If this button is not pressed the word generator value will be read without
any pause.</p>
<img src="image/wordgen1.jpg" alt="Word Generator" align="right"/>
<p>The indicator lights show the following conditions:</p>
<ul compact>
<li><b>Parity</b>
<br>a parity error has been detected in the core store - this cannot 
happen in the simulator.</li>
<li><b>Block Transfer</b>
<br>a data transfer is happening to or from a device - this will flicker
on and off when reading or writing tapes for example.</li>
<li><b>Busy</b>
<br>the system is waiting for input or output - typically waiting
for a tape to loaded in a tape reader or punch.</li>
<li><b>Floating Point Overflow</b> 
<br>a floating point operation has overflowed - execution stops if this occurs 
and will only continue when the <i>Operate</i> bar is pressed.</li>
<li><b>Step by Step</b> 
<br>the system is stopped waiting for operator action - this is the condition 
on start up, after the <i>Reset</i> key is pressed or if the <i>Read</i> or 
<i>Obey</i> buttons are selected.</li>
<li><b>Overflow</b> 
<br>the overflow condition is set - this will usually flicker on and off 
as programs are loaded or run.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Volume</i> slider controls the level of the <a href="#sound">sounds</a>
produced by the console speaker.
Setting the volume to 0 will switch off all sounds.</p>
<p>This window is supposed to look and operate somewhat like the real Elliott
803 operator console.</p>
<h3 id="opcpu">The CPU and Core Store</h3>
<img src="image/opcpu.jpg" alt="CPU" align="left"/>
<img src="image/opcore.jpg" alt="Core Store" align="right"/>
<p>The CPU window shows the values of some of the important internal registers as
execution proceeds.
This includes the currently executing instruction and the contents of the
accumulator and auxiliary registers.
When running in step-by-step mode the CPU window will display the next 
instruction that is about to be executed.</p>
<table frame="void" rules="none">
<tr><td>At the bottom of the window are two debug options:
<ul>
<li>Pressing the <i>Dump</i> button will produce a
<a href="extras.html#dump">system core dump</a>.
This can be formatted and displayed using the
<a href="utilities.html#pcore">Core File Formatter</a> utility.
<br><br></li>
<li>Selecting the <i>Trace</i> option will turn on and off the
<a href="extras.html#trace">system instruction trace</a>.
This can be formatted and displayed using the
<a href="utilities.html#ptrace">Trace File Formatter</a> utility.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table>
<br clear="left">
<p>The core store window shows a view of the 8K words of store.
It is intended to give a rough idea of where in store work is taking place.</p>
<p>The window shows 128 lines of 64 small blocks, each block representing a single
word of store.
The block will be white if the word of store contains zero, otherwise it will
alternate between light and dark grey whenever a value is written to the
storage location.</p>
<h4 id="perf">Important Performance Note</h4>
<p>When running in <a href="#speed"><i>real time</i></a> mode the the simulation 
will operate at a very close approximation to the speed of a real Elliott 803B - 
this can be quite slow compared to modern machines especially when reading tapes
or printing output (the teletype operates at about 10 characters per second).</p>
<p>If <i>real time</i> mode is deselected the simulation will simply run as fast
as possible, however the frequent updates to the CPU and Core Store windows that 
take place as execution proceeds considerably slow down the speed of the emulation.  
If you want processing to run at a much faster speed one or both of these
windows should be minimized.</p>
<h3 id="optele">The Output Teletype</h3>
<img src="image/optele.jpg" alt="Output Teletype" align="left"/>
<p>The output teletype shows the printed output from the computer.
The data will scroll up as new lines are output or when the <i>Scroll</i>
button is pressed.</p>
<p>To save output from the teletype press the <i>Save...</i> button and set a
log file to store the output.
New output will be appended to the end of any existing log file.
The log file will be closed if the <i>Clear</i> button is pressed and this
will also clear any current teletype output.</p>
<p>When selecting a log file you will need to choose an appropriate
<a href="#tmode">tape format</a> for the resulting log file.
<br clear="left">
<h3 id="opplot">The Graph Plotter</h3>
<img src="image/opplot.jpg" alt="Graph Plotter" align="left"/>
<p>The graph plotter displays any plotter output generated.
The output is scaled so that the current width of the plotter window 
represents the full width of a real Calcomp plotter, that is 11 inches.
<p>Pressing the <i>Clear</i> button will clear the plotter output and
reset the pen to the left hand edge.
Take care pressing <i>Clear</i> as the image cannot be recovered without
re-running the program that generated it. 
<br clear="left">
<h3 id="optape">The Paper Tape Readers and Punches</h3>
<img src="image/oprdr.jpg" alt="Tape Reader" align="left"/>
<img src="image/oppch.jpg" alt="Tape Punch" align="left"/>
<p>The paper tape readers and paper tape punches are the primary means
of input/output for the computer.
&quot;Tapes&quot; are held as files on the host PC system and the <i>Load</i>
and <i>Save</i> buttons on the tape devices produce a file selection dialog
that allows the tape files to be selected.</p>
<p>When selecting a tape file you will need to choose an appropriate
<a href="#tmode">tape format</a> for the file.</p>
<br clear="left">
There are two lights on the tape devices to show their current status
<ul>
<li><b>Busy</b> will be illuminated if the device is reading or writing data.
It will go out when the device is idle.  This can be used to determine when,
for example, a tape has finished loading.</li>
<li><b>Waiting</b> will be illuminated if the device has had a read or write
operation issued against it but it has no tape loaded.
The CPU will be in a busy wait until either a tape file is loaded into the
device so operation can continue or the <i>Reset</i> key on the operators
console is pressed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tmode">Tape Formats</h4>
<p>When reading or writing files using the tape readers and tape punches you need
to consider the format of the tape file that is to be read or written.
Tapes can be in <i>Elliott</i> format or in <i>System</i> format.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Elliott</i> format tapes are either binary program tapes or tapes
whose characters are encoded as Elliott telecode.</li>
<li><i>System</i> tapes are text tapes (such as program source code or
program data) that are encoded as normal text files on the PC.</li>
</ul>
<img src="image/tmode.jpg" alt="Tape Format" align="right"/>
<p>The file selection dialogs contain a panel on the right hand side that allows
the correct tape format to be selected.
Depending on the action requested the tape format will offer one or more of
the following options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Auto</b></dt><dd>The tape format will be automatically selected.
This is the default format for the tape readers and is normally the correct
one to choose.
The contents of the file will be examined to determine if it is an Elliott
binary or telecode tape or if it is a system text file.</dd>
<dt><b>Elliott</b></dt><dd>The tape is in Elliott binary or telecode format.
This is the default format for the tape punches, as it is assumed they may
be writing binary data (such as compiler output tapes).
If the output is text it will be encoded in telecode and can be converted
to the system character set using the
<a href="utilities.html#tprint">TapePrint</a> utility.</dd>
<dt><b>System</b></dt><dd>The tape is in standard system format.
This is the default format for teleprinter output.
This is only suitable for text input or output - the characters read or
written to the tape will be automatically converted from or to telecode
as necessary.</dd>
<dt><b>US-ASCII</b></dt><dd>This option is only available with the <b>System</b>
output format.
It ensures that only characters from the US-ASCII character set are used
when converting from telecode to system characters, in particular the
GB pound sign character (<code>&pound;</code>) will be written as the number 
sign (<code>#</code>).</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="sound">Sound Output</h3>
<p>On a real 803 machine whenever the CPU executed certain instructions (any
instruction from groups 4, 5, 6 or 7) a pulse would be sent to the loudspeaker
in the operator console.
In general this results in fairly random noise being generated as programs
execute, although repeating sequences of instuctions or carefully chosen 
sets could create recognizable sounds.
For example a jump instruction (a group 4 opcode) would produce a pulse, a
jump to the location with the jump instruction would result in a tight spin
loop with one pulse every 288us - which gives a steady tone of about 3.5kHz.
See the <a href="samples.html#music">music sample program</a> for another 
example.</p>
<img src="image/volume.jpg" alt="Volume" align="left">
<p>The simulation attempts to replicate these sounds using the PC sound
card.
The volume of sound produced can be controlled using the <i>Volume</i>
slider on the Operator Console.
Note that for sound to be produced the simulation must be set to be 
running in <a href="#speed"><i>real time</i></a> mode.</p>
<br clear="left">
<h4 id="perfs">Important Performance Note</h4>
<p>To generate accurate sounds a reasonably fast PC is needed.
On a slower machine, particularly with a single core processor, it may be 
necessary to minimize the CPU and Core Store windows to improve sound output.  
If sound performance still seems break up or stutter, it
is probably best to turn the sound off by setting the volume slider to 0 or
starting the program with the<code> -volume 0 </code>parameter.</p> 
<hr>
<h2 id="pload">Loading Programs</h2>
<p>If you are patient, careful and very meticulous it is possible to enter
a complete program and run it using only the operator's console.
If you want to try, here's a very simple two line program that will print
a series of 'A's to the teletype:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>128:  74 4127 : 74 4097          * Print a letter shift and a letter 'A'    
129:  40  128 : 00    0          * Jump to location 128 to repeat</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This could be entered and run using the following sequence of operations:</p>
<table frame="box" rules="all" cellpadding="3">

</table>
<h3 id="initins">Initial Instructions</h3>
<p>Clearly this method of loading and running programs is impractical for any program
of any size, so the 803 provides a better solution.
Storage locations 0 through to 3 contain hard-wired instructions called the <i>Initial
Instructions</i>, these are a bootstrap program that can load binary data from paper
tape (in tape reader 1) into consecutive words in store.
Since a word is 39 bits and each character on tape is 5 bits, it takes 8 tape
characters for each word of store.</p>
<p>For interest, the initial instructions are these:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>0:  26 4 : 06 0
1:  22 4 / 16 3
2:  55 5 : 71 0
3:  43 1 : 40 2</code>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>They use just one extra word (location 4) of working storage and can load
the program into any location in store - the first word read from the tape 
defines the load address for the rest of the data.
You might like to try to figure out how it works!</p>
<p>This means the standard way of loading a program is to put the program tape
into the reader and execute a jump to location 0 to invoke the initial instructions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cmd">Command Line Interface</h2>
<p>The simulator can also be run as a command line function, although this is
probably less useful for most people.</p>
<h3>Command</h3>
<blockquote><pre>
<code>java <b>elliott803.Run</b> [options] programtape [entryaddress]</code>
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<blockquote><dl>
<dt><code>programtape</code></dt>
<dd>The binary program tape to be loaded by the initial instructions.</dd>
<dt><code>entryaddress</code></dt>
<dd>The program entry point address to jump to after the tape is loaded.
This will be ignored for a self-triggering program tape.</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<h4>Options</h4>
<blockquote><dl>
<dt><code>-reader1 <i>inputtape</i></code></dt>
<dd>The tape to load in reader 1 (after program tape is read).</dd>
<dt><code>-reader2 <i>inputtape</i></code></dt>
<dd>The tape to load in reader 2.</dd>
<dt><code>-punch1 <i>outputtape</i></code></dt>
<dd>The output tape file for punch 1</dd>
<dt><code>-punch2 <i>outputtape</i></code></dt>
<dd>The output tape file for punch 2</dd>
<dt><code>-teletype <i>outputfile</i></code></dt>
<dd>The output file for teletype, defaults to standard out</dd>
<dt><code>-wordgen <i>&quot;instruction&quot;</i></code></dt>
<dd>The value to set on the word generator, formatted as an instruction 
e.g. <code>"70 1 : 00 1"</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>-press <i>keynumber</i></code></dt>
<dd>A key to press if the system waits for keyboard input.
The top-left key (the Function 1 &quot;40&quot; or sign bit) is keynumber 1, 
the bottom right key (the Address 2 &quot;1&quot; bit) is keynumber 39.  
Other typically useful keynumbers are 20 (the B-digit) and 21 (the 
Function 2 &quot;40&quot; bit).</dd>
<dt><code>-ascii</code></dt>
<dd>Print using only US-ASCII characters</dd>
<dt><code>-dump</code></dt>
<dd>Produce a system dump on exit</dd>
<dt><code>-trace</code></dt>
<dd>Produce a full instruction trace</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>As an example the sample <a href="samples.html#charset">Character Set</a> program
can be run with this command.
This will result in the telecode character set being printed to the terminal or
command line session.</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<code>java elliott803.Run -ascii tapes/samples/charset.tape</code>
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>Running ALGOL Programs from the Command Line</h4>
<p>An ALGOL source program cannot be directly compiled and run using the command
line interface, however it is possible use the graphical interface to compile a
program and produce a <i>dump tape</i> of the compiled source and runtime.
This dump tape can then be run from the command line.</p>
<p>To produce a <i>dump tape</i> start by loading the ALGOL compiler and 
compiling your program as described in <a href="algol.html#using">Running
ALGOL Programs</a>.
Proceed up to step <i>3</i> of the <a href="algol.html#comprun">Compiling
and Running a Program</a> section.
At this point, instead of running the program, press the <i>Reset</i> button
and execute a <b>40 12</b> instruction from the console.
The system will then write the dump tape of the compiled program to 
Punch 1.</p>
<p>The resulting tape is in a form that can loaded and run directly without 
needing the ALGOL compiler, so it can be run using the command line interface.
After loading the tape the system will enter a <i>Data Wait</i>, so a 
command line option of<code> -press 21 </code>is needed to cause
it to execute.</p> 
<p>As an example the <a href="algol.html#trig">Trigonometric Table</a> ALGOL
program has been compiled to a sample dump tape and can be run with this command.
<blockquote><pre>
<code>java elliott803.Run -press 21 tapes/samples/trig.dump.tape</code>
</pre></blockquote> 
<p>The program will end in a spin loop, you will need to press <i>Ctrl-C</i>
to end the process.</p>
