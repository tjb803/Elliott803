<h1>Source Code Details</h1>
<p>These notes provide some details about the source code and implementation
of the simulator.</p>
<h3>Obtaining The Source Code</h3>
<p>The source code can be obtained in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the source package from the SourceForge download site. 
<p>The source package is named <code>elliott803-src-n.n.n.zip</code> and
contains the full Java source for the project classes.</p></li>
<li>Download the source directly from the SourceForge SVN code repository
listed below.
Read-only access to the code in SVN should be available to anyone, if 
you want ot update the code you will need a SourceForge ID and you will
need to be added to project. 
<blockquote><pre>
https://elliott803.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/elliott803
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The SVN repository is structured in the usual way - the latest version of
the code can be found in the &quot;trunk&quot; stream with previous releases
available via the &quot;tags&quot; streams. 
The directory called <code>Elliott803</code> should be checked-out of SVN as
a complete Eclipse Java project.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Using Eclipse and the SVN repository is recommended if you want to try
to rebuild or modify the code.
In addition to the source for the simulator classes the SVN project also 
contains a number of JUnit unit tests and the ANT build script used to
create the project download packages.</p>
<h3>Code Design</h3>
<p>The code is designed using an approximate Model-View-Controller type of 
architecture, to split the GUI View logic completely from the core emulation
which combines the Model and the Controller function.
The intention is that the relatively simple Swing-based UI could be fairly 
easily replaced with more fancy graphics if required, without needing any
changes to hardware simulation.</p>
<h3>Java Packages</h3>
<p>The source code is structured into the following Java packages:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code><b>elliott803</b></code></dt>
<dd>The base package containing the two 'main()' entry points: <code>Main.java</code>
is the main GUI program and <code>Run.java</code> is the command line version.
(The command line version is probably not very useful anymore but I did use it
to test things before I had written the GUI.)</dd>
<dt><code><b>elliott803.hardware</b></code></dt>
<dd>The classes that implement various pieces of real 803 hardware, for example 
the CPU, the tape readers, the teletype etc.</dd>
<dt><code><b>elliott.hardware.device</b></code></dt>
<dd>Some base classes that provide general support common to all of the hardware
devices, in particular those that can signal 'busy' conditions and respond to 
the 7x instruction opcodes.</dd>
<dt><code><b>elliott.machine</b></code></dt>
<dd>The more abstract classes relating to the core emulation that are not related
to specific pieces of real hardware.</dd>
<dt><code><b>elliott803.machine.extension</b></code></dt>
<dd>Classes that provide extensions to the computer that are useful for the simulator
but do not represent function present on a real 803, for example the random number
generator.</dd>
<dt><code><b>elliott803.view</b></code></dt>
<dd>The GUI 'view' classes.
All of the visuals are contained withing these classes (and the component 
sub-package) and there is only a simple and well defined split between the view
code and the core emulation code.</dd> 
<dt><code><b>elliott803.view.component</b></code></dt>
<dd>These are simple (generally, expect maybe the DisplayPlot one!) and often 
reusable components used to build the GUI views.  
They are used whenever there is not a standard Swing component that is suitable.</dd>
<dt><code><b>elliott803.telecode</b></code></dt>
<dd>These classes handle all the conversion from Java characters to Elliott
Telecode characters and <i>vice-versa</i>.
There are simple character converters and more complex conversion input and 
output streams which fit in nicely with the Java I/O models.</dd>
<dt><code><b>elliott803.utils</b></code></dt>
<dd>All of the additional utility programs, including the simple assembler.</dd>
<dt><code><b>elliott803.icon</b></code></dt>
<dd>Some icons in various formats that are used internally and also packaged as
part of the distrubtion ZIP for others to use.</dd>
