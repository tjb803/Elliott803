<p>Some further details of how programs are loaded and run are given here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#pload">Loading Programs</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="gui">Interactive GUI</h2>
<p>The GUI interface can be started by running the simulator JAR file or by
running the <code>elliott803.Main</code> program within the JAR.</p>
<h3>Command</h3>
<blockquote><pre>
   <code>java -jar elliott803-n.n.n.jar [options] [machine]</code> 
or <code>java <b>elliott803.Main</b> [options] [machine]</code>
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<blockquote><dl>
<dt><code>machine</code></dt><dd>A previously saved machine image.</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<h4>Options</h4>
<blockquote><dl>
<dt><code>-look <i>lookandfeel</i></code></dt><dd>The name of the Java GUI 
look-and-feel to use.
By default the standard platform look-and-feel will be used.
Other look-and-feels that may be available (depending on operating system
and Java version) include: <code>metal</code>, <code>windows</code>, 
<code>classic</code>, <code>motif</code>, <code>gtk</code> and <code>nimbus</code>.
</dd>
<dt><code>-load</code></dt><dd>Prompt to load a saved machine image 
when the simulator starts.</dd>
<dt><code>-save</code></dt><dd>Prompt to save the current machine image
when the simulator ends.</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>The GUI interface displays a main window containing several smaller internal
windows representing the various hardware and devices that form the Elliott
803 simulation.
These windows can be moved around and resized (or minimized) as required.
The current layout can be saved when the simulator is closed and restarted
next time.</p>
<p>Most interaction will take place with the paper tape reader and tape punch
devices and with the system operator's console.</p>
<h3 id="start">Start Up and Shut Down</h3>
<p>When the simulator starts up it can load a pre-saved machine image containing
the complete core memeory contents and the size, position any layout of all
the application windows.</p>
<p>The image can either be provided as a parameter when starting the application
or the option <code><b>-load</b></code> can be used and the system will prompt
to select the image to use.
If no image is provided a default window layout will be used. 
<p>When the simulator is closed it can optionally prompt to save the current
machine image ready to restart next time.  
This can be useful if you have resized and re-arranged the windows or if you
want to avoid having to reload large data tapes such as the ALGOL compiler.
The option <code><b>-save</b></code> should be used when starting the application 
to tell it to prompt to save the image when it closes.
<h3 id="opcon">The Operator Console</h3>
<img src="image/opcon.jpg" alt="Operator Console" align="left"/>
<p>The operator console is the mechanism by which the computer is operated.
There are 39 buttons on the left hand side called the <i>Word Generator</i>.
These buttons are used to form complete machine words, typically instructions.
For convenience the value of the instruction currently formed by the buttons on
the word generator is shown at the bottom of the window.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When one of these 39 buttons is pressed it will stay pressed down.
You can release the button, and all other buttons in the same group, by pressing 
the red release button (marked with an <i>R</i>) at the far left of the row.</p>
<p>On the right hand side are the various operation buttons and indicator lights.
The <i>Clear Store</i> button sets all storage locations to zero.  The <i>Reset</i>
button stops any current execution, clears any &quot;busy&quot; condition and
returns control to the console.</p>
<p>The three buttons marked <i>Read</i>, <i>Normal</i> and <i>Obey</i> are used
in conjunction with the <i>Operate</i> bar to operate the computer.
To use them you first select the function required by pressing one of the three
buttons then hit the <i>Operate</i> bar to execute it.</p>
<p>The <i>Read</i> function reads the instruction currently set on the word
generator buttons to the CPU instruction register, ready to be executed.
The <i>Obey</i> function obeys the next instruction then returns to step-by-step
mode.
The <i>Normal</i> function obeys the next instruction and continues executing
instructions normally.</p>
<p id="boot">So a typical sequence of operations to cause a jump to the 
<a href="#initns">initial instructions</a> at location zero (to load a program 
from the tape reader) would be:</p>
<ul compact>
<li>Set the instruction <b>40 0 : 00 0</b> on the word generator (this just needs
the top left-most button pressed).</li>
<li>Select <i>Read</i>, <i>Operate</i> to load up that <b>40 0</b> instruction
ready to be run.</li>
<li>Select <i>Normal</i>, <i>Operate</i> to run the jump instruction and to continue
running normally.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Manual Data</i> is used to cause the system to wait (until the <i>Operate</i>
bar is pressed) whenever an instruction to read the word generator is executed.
If this button is not pressed the word generator value will be read without
any pause.</p>
<p>The indicator lights show the following conditions:
<img src="image/wordgen1.jpg" alt="Word Generator" align="right"/></p>
<ul compact>
<li><b>Busy</b> the system is waiting for input or output - typically waiting
for a tape to loaded in a tape reader or punch.</li>
<li><b>Floating Point Overflow</b> a floating point operation has overflowed.
Execution stops if this occurs and will only continue when the <i>Operate</i>
bar is pressed.</li>
<li><b>Step by Step</b> the system is stopped waiting for operator action.
This is the condition on start up, after the <i>Reset</i> key is pressed or 
if the <i>Read</i> or <i>Obey</i> buttons are selected.</li>
<li><b>Overflow</b> the overflow condition is set.  
This will usually flicker on and off as programs are loaded or run.</li>
</ul>
<p>This window is supposed to look and operate somewhat like the real Elliott
803 operator console</p>
<br clear="right">
<h3 id="opcpu">The CPU and Core Store</h3>
<img src="image/opcpu.jpg" alt="CPU" align="left"/>
<img src="image/opcore.jpg" alt="Core Store" align="right"/>
<p>The CPU window shows the values of some of the important internal registers as
execution proceeds.
This includes the currently executing instruction and the contents of the
accumulator and auxiliary registers.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the window are two debug options:</p>
<table frame="void" rules="none">
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the <i>Dump</i> button will produce a
<a href="extras.html#dump">system core dump</a>.
This can be formatted and displayed using the
<a href="utilities.html#pdump">Core File Formatter</a> utility.</li>
<li>Selecting the <i>Trace</i> option will turn on and off the
<a href=extras.html#trace">system instruction trace</a>.
This can be formatted and displayed using the
<a href="utilities.html#ptrace">Trace File Formatter</a> utility.</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table>
<br clear="left">
<p>The core store window shows a view of the 8K words of store.
It is intended to give a rough idea of where in store work is taking place.</p>
<p>The window shows 128 lines of 64 small blocks, each block representing a single
word of store.
The block will be white if the word of store contains zero, otherwise it will
alternate between light and dark grey whenever a value is written to the
storage location.
The core store is an output only window.</p>
<h4 id="perf">Important Performance Note</h4>
<p>The frequent updates to the CPU and Core Store windows that take place as 
execution proceeds considerably slow down the speed of the emulation.  
If you want processing to run at a much faster speed one or both of these
windows should be minimized.
<br clear="left">
<h3 id="optele">The Output Teletype</h3>
<img src="image/optele.jpg" alt="Output Teletype" align="left"/>
<p>The output teletype shows the printed output from the computer.
The data will scroll up as new lines are output.</p>
<p>To save output from the teletype press the <i>Save...</i> button and set a
log file to store the output.
New output will be appended to the end of any existing log file.
The log file will be closed if the <i>Clear</i> button is pressed and this
will also clear any current teletype output.</p>
<p>When selecting a log file you will need to choose an appropriate
<a href="#tmode">tape format</a> for the resulting log file.
<br clear="left">
<h3 id="opplot">The Graph Plotter</h3>
<img src="image/opplot.jpg" alt="Graph Plotter" align="left"/>
<p>The graph plotter displays any plotter output generated.
The output is scaled so that the current width of the plotter window 
represents the full width of a real Calcomp plotter, that is 11 inches.
<p>Pressing the <i>Clear</i> button will clear the plotter output and
reset the pen to the left hand edge.
Take care pressing <i>Clear</i> as the image cannot be recovered without
re-running the program that generated it. 
<br clear="left">
<h3 id="optape">The Paper Tape Readers and Punches</h3>
<img src="image/oprdr.jpg" alt="Tape Reader" align="left"/>
<img src="image/oppch.jpg" alt="Tape Punch" align="left"/>
<p>The paper tape readers and paper tape punches are the primary means
of input/output for the computer.
&quot;Tapes&quot; are held as files on the host PC system and the <i>Load</i>
and <i>Save</i> buttons on the tape devices produce a file selection dialog
that allows the tape files to be selected.</p>
<p>When selecting a tape file you will need to choose an appropriate
<a href="#tmode">tape format</a> for the file.</p>
<br clear="left">
There are two lights on the tape devices to show their current status
<ul>
<li><b>Busy</b> will be illuminated if the device is reading or writing data.
It will go out when the device is idle.  This can be used to determine when,
for example, a tape has finished loading.</li>
<li><b>Waiting</b> will be illuminated if the device has had a read or write
operation issued against it but it has no tape loaded.
The CPU will be in a busy wait until either a tape file is loaded into the
device so operation can continue or the <i>Reset</i> key on the operators
console is pressed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="oppts">The Paper Tape Station</h4>
<img src="image/oppts.jpg" alt="Tape Reader" align="left"/>
<p>The paper tape station provides additional control over the tape
readers and punches allowing the readers amd/or punches to be exchanged.
When the appropriate option is selected the CPU will see Reader 1
(or Punch 1) as Reader 2 (or Punch 2) and <i>vice-versa</i>.</p>
<br clear="left">
<h4 id="tmode">Tape Formats</h4>
<p>When reading or writing files using the tape readers and tape punches you need
to consider the format of the tape file that is to be read or written.
Tapes can be in <i>Elliott</i> format or in <i>System</i> format.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Elliott</i> format tapes are either binary program tapes or tapes
whose characters are encoded as Elliott telecode.</li>
<li><i>System</i> tapes are text tapes (such as program source code or
program data) that are encoded as normal text files on the PC.</li>
</ul>
<img src="image/tmode.jpg" alt="Tape Format" align="right"/>
<p>The file selection dialogs contain a panel on the right hand side that allows
the correct tape format to be selected.
Depending on the action requested the tape format will offer one or more of
the following options:</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Auto</b></dt><dd>The tape format will be automatically selected.
This is the default format for the tape readers and is normally the correct
one to choose.
The contents of the file will be examined to determine if it is an Elliott
binary or telecode tape or if it is a system text file.</dd>
<dt><b>Elliott</b></dt><dd>The tape is in Elliott binary or telecode format.
This is the default format for the tape punches, as it is assumed they may
be writing binary data (such as compiler output tapes).
If the output is text it will be encoded in telecode and can be converted
to the system character set using the
<a href=utilites.html#tprint">TapePrint</a> utility</dd>
<dt><b>System</b></dt><dd>The tape is in standard system format.
This is the default format for teleprinter output.
This is only suitable for text input or output - the characters read or
written to the tape will be automatically converted from or to telecode
as necessary.</dd>
<dt><b>US-ASCII</b></dt><dd>This option is only available with the <b>System</b>
output format.
It ensures that only characters from the US-ASCII character set are used
when converting from telecode to system characters, in particular the
GB pound sign character (<code>&pound;</code>) will be written as the number 
sign (<code>#</code>).</dd>
</dl>
<hr>
<h2 id="pload">Loading Programs</h2>
<p>If you are patient, careful and very meticulous it is possible to enter
a complete program and run it using only the operator's console.
If you want to try, here's a very simple two line program that will print
a series of 'A's to the teletype:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>128:  74 4127 : 74 4097          * Print a letter shift and an 'A'    
129:  40  128 : 00    0          * Jump to location 128 to repeat</code></pre></blockquote>
<p>This could be entered and run using the following sequence of operations:</p>
<table frame="box" rules="all" cellpadding="3">

<h3 id="initins">Initial Instructions</h3>
<p>Clearly this method of loading and running programs is impractical for any program
of any size, so the 803 provides a better solution.
Storage locations 0 through to 3 contain hard-wired instructions called the <i>Initial
Instructions</i>, these are a bootstrap program that can load binary data from paper
tape (in tape reader 1) into consecutive words in store.
Since a word is 39 bits and each character on tape is 5 bits, it takes 8 tape
characters for each word of store.</p>
<p>For interest, the initial instructions are these:</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>0:  26 4 : 06 0
1:  22 4 / 16 3
2:  55 5 : 71 0
3:  43 1 : 40 2</code>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>They use just one extra word (location 4) of working storage and can load
the program into any location in store - the first word read from the tape 
defines the load address for the rest of the data.
You might like to try to figure out how it works!</p>
<p>This means the standard way of loading a program is to put the program tape
into the reader and execute a jump to location 0 to invoke the initial instructions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="cmd">Command Line Interface</h2>
<p>The simulator can also be run as a command line function, although this is
probably less useful for most people.</p>
<h3>Command</h3>
<blockquote><pre>
<code>java <b>elliott803.Run</b> [options] programtape [entryaddress]</code>
</pre></blockquote>
<h4>Parameters</h4>
<blockquote><dl>
<dt><code>programtape</code></dt><dd>The binary program tape to be loaded by
the initial instructions.</dd>
<dt><code>entryaddress</code></dt><dd>The program entry point address to jump to
after the tape is loaded.
This will be ignored for a self-triggering program tape.</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<h4>Options</h4>
<blockquote><dl>
<dt><code>-reader1 <i>inputtape</i></code></dt><dd>The tape to load in reader 1 (after program tape is read)</dd>
<dt><code>-reader2 <i>inputtape</i></code></dt><dd>The tape to load in reader 2</dd>
<dt><code>-punch1 <i>outputtape</i></code></dt><dd>The output tape file for punch 1</dd>
<dt><code>-punch2 <i>outputtape</i></code></dt><dd>The output tape file for punch 2</dd>
<dt><code>-teletype <i>outputfile</i></code></dt><dd>The output file for teletype, defaults to standard out</dd>
<dt><code>-wordgen <i>&quot;instruction&quot;</i></code></dt><dd>The value to set on the word 
generator, formatted as an instruction e.g. <code>"70 1 : 00 1"</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>-press <i>keynumber</i></code></dt><dd>A key to press if the system waits for keyboard input.
The top-left key (the Function 1 &quot;40&quot; or sign bit) is keynumber 1, the bottom right key 
(the Address 2 &quot;1&quot; bit) is keynumber 39.  
Other typically useful keynumbers are 20 (the B-digit) and 21 (the Function 2 &quot;40&quot; bit).</dd>
<dt><code>-ascii</code></dt><dd>Print using only US-ASCII characters</dd>
<dt><code>-dump</code></dt><dd>Produce a system dump on exit</dd>
<dt><code>-trace</code></dt><dd>Produce a full instruction trace</dd>
</dl></blockquote>
<p>As an example the sample <a href="samples.html#charset">Character Set</a> program
can be run with this command.
This will result in the telecode character set being printed to the terminal or
command line session.</p>
