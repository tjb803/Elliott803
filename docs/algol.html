<h1>The ALGOL Compiler</h1>
<p>The Elliott 803 had an excellent compiler for the then new ALGOL 60
programming language.
ALGOL 60 was one of the first &quot;block structured&quot; languages and was 
hugely influential on just about everything that has come since.
For more information on ALGOL 60 itself try Wikipedia

<h2 id="ealgol">Elliott ALGOL Notes</h2>
<p>The Elliott ALGOL compiler was an almost complete implementation of ALGOL 
60, however there were a few limitations and some changes from the defined 
reference language.
In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The limited telecode character set meant that all keywords and variables 
had to be in uppercase only and many of the special symbols used in ALGOL 
were not available.
The unavailable symbols were replaced with various symbol and letter sequences, 
for example:<blockquote><table frame="void" rules="none">
<tr><td><code>GR</code></td><td width="15"/><td>for</td><td width="15"/><td><code>&gt;</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>DIV</code></td><td/><td>for</td><td/><td><code>&divide;</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>NOTEQ</code></td><td/><td>for</td><td/><td><code>&ne;</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>**</code></td><td/><td>for</td><td/><td><code>&uarr;</code></td>
<td>... and several others</td></tr> 
<tr><td colspan="6">Three particularly important (but slightly odd) substitutions are:</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>'</code>  (apostrophe)</td><td/><td>for</td><td/><td><code>;</code>  (semicolon)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&pound;</code>  (GB pound sign)</td><td/><td>for</td><td/><td><code>&lsquo;</code>  (open string quote)</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>?</code>  (question mark)</td><td/><td>for</td><td/><td><code>&rsquo;</code>  (close string quote)</td></tr>
</table></blockquote></li>
<li>All ALGOL programs must start with a title followed by an apostrophe.</li>
<li>The final END keyword must be followed by an apostrophe.</li>
<li>All identifiers are distinguished only by their first 6 characters.</li>
<li>All labels used must be declared in a SWITCH statement</li>
<li>There were special PRINT and READ statements to perform I/O to and from the 
tape punches, tape readers and output teletype.</li>
<li>... and several others</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example here's a simple program in the ALGOL reference notation 
and in the Elliott format:</p>
<table frame="box" rules="all" cellpadding="3" width="100%">
<col width="50%"><col width="50%">

  s1: y[i] := sin((x/180 x 3.14159);
      <b>comment</b> No I/O functions are defined in Algol;
      i := i + 1;  x := x + 30;

      PRINT X, SAMELINE, Y(I)'
      I := I + 1'  X := X + 30'
      IF I LESSEQ 12 THEN GOTO S1'
END'</code></pre></td></tr>

<h2 id="using">Running ALGOL Programs</h2>
<p>To run ALGOL programs on the Elliott 803 you must first load the ALGOL compiler.
The compiler was supplied as two large reels of paper tape - tape 1 was the 
compiler itself and tape 2 was a set of run-time routines used by both the 
compiler and the executing program.
Getting everything to fit in 8K of store was something of a miracle and large
programs would often need to overwrite some of the compiler space when they ran,
requiring the compiler tapes to be loaded again before the next program could
be run.
Loading, and particularly re-winding, those large reels of tape was a slow 
and rather tiresome process - this is something that is much quicker and 
simpler using the simulator!</p>
<p>Short programs, such as the included samples, were normally run in a 
&quot;compile, load and go&quot; mode.
Once the compiler was loaded, a program source tape was put in the reader
and compiled in-store, when compiled it was run and its output was printed to 
the output teletype.
As long as the compiler was not overwritten, further programs could then 
be compiled and run without the need to reload the compiler tapes.</p>
<h3 id="loadc">Loading the Compiler</h3>
<p>Use this sequence of operations to load the ALGOL compiler.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place the ALGOL compiler tape 1 in the reader.
<br>The tape is found in the directory <code>tapes/algol</code> and is called 
<code>a104-1.tape</code>
(A104 was the name of the ALGOL library tapes).</li>
<li>Use the console to execute a jump to location 0 to run the 
<a href="operation.html#boot">initial instructions</a> to load the tape.</li>
<li>Wait for the tape to finish loading.
You should see it being written to the <a href="operation.html#opcpu">core store</a>
window and you will hear a fairly constant rumbling noise as the tape loads.   
When complete, the <i>busy</i> light will go out on the reader and a high
pitch tone (of around 1kHz) known as a <i>System Wait</i> will be heard.
<br><i>Note: </i>When running in <a href="operation.html#speed"><i>real time</i></a>
it will take around 2 minutes 25 seconds to load this tape - it may be sensible to 
switch out of real time mode while loading the compiler tapes.</li>
<li>Place the ALGOL compiler tape 2 in the reader.
<br>The tape is found in the directory <code>tapes/algol</code> and is called 
<code>a104-2.tape</code></li>
<li>On the word generator section of the operator console, change the state
of the top left-most button (the &quot;Function 1&quot; 40 button) and the 
second tape should load.
(To change the state of the button: if it is already pressed - as it probably 
will be - release it by pressing the red release key at the far left; if it is 
already released press it down.)</li>
<li>Wait for the tape to finish loading.
Again a fairly steady rumbling noise will be heard as the tape loads.
<br><i>Note: </i>When running in <i>real time</i> it will take about 1 minute 
10 seconds to load this tape.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point the system is ready to compile a program.  
It will be in the <i>System Wait</i> state with a high pitch tone 
coming from the speaker.</p>
<h3>Using a Preloaded Machine Image</h3>
<p>As an alternative to loading the two compiler tapes each time they are 
required it is possible to either start the simulator using a <i>machine image</i>
parameter or use the <a href="operation.html#image"><i>Load...</i></a> button on 
the simulation control window to restore a machine image containing a pre-loaded 
compiler.
A pre-loaded compiler image can be found in <code>samples/machines/algol.803</code>.</p>
<p>If the pre-loaded image is used you will need to execute a <b>40 7</b> instruction
to begin compiling a new program.
<h3 id="comprun">Compiling and Running a Program</h3>
<p>When the compiler has been loaded it is ready to compile and run programs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Place a program source tape into the reader.
<br>Pick one of the <a href="#samples">sample ALGOL programs</a> or choose 
one of your own.</li>
<li>Again change the state of the top left-most button (the &quot;Function 1&quot;
40 button) on the word generator.
<br>The program source will be read and compiled and a set of fairly random
noises will be generated as the tape is processed and compilation takes place. 
When the first phase of compilation is complete the program title will be printed
on the teletype and a short time later, when the second phase is complete a 
message about the amount of <code>FREE STORE</code> will be printed.<p>
<p>The program is now in what is known as a <i>Data Wait</i> indicated by
a two-tone siren sound coming from the speaker.
If the program requires additional data tapes they should be loaded into
the readers at this point.</p></li>
<li>This time change the state of the &quot;Function 2&quot; left-most 40 
button and the program should run.
<br>The sample programs will all produce some output on the teletype.</li>
<li>When finished an <code>END OF PROGRAM</code> message will be produced
on the teletype.</li>
</ol>
<p>If all went well the system is now back in a <i>System Wait</i> (high 
pitch tone) ready to compile and run another program.
You can repeat from step (1) above.</p>
<p>If things didn't quite go to plan you may need to press the <i>Reset</i> key
on the operator console to get control back.
You may then execute a jump (i.e. a <b>40</b> instruction to one of several 
locations to continue.
The two most useful are probably:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>40 6</b> to re-run the last compiled program.</li>
<li><b>40 7</b> to reset to step (1) above to compile and run a new program.</li>
</ul>
<p>If things go very wrong the simplest action is to <i>Reset</i> and to 
reload the whole ALGOL system starting again from
<a href="#loadc">Loading the Compiler</a>.</p>

<p>This is a very simple algol &quot;hello world&quot; program.
It just prints a short message to the output teletype.</p>
<p>The source code for this program uses only characters from the
standard Elliott telecode character set, so it looks exactly like a
genuine 803 ALGOL program, with the slight exception that it uses the 
# (number sign) in place of the &pound; (GB pound sign) as this can cause 
problems with PC character encodings. 
Note that it is all in uppercase and has apostrophes (rather than semicolons) 
as statement separators and uses the # and ? characters as string quotes.
The <code>PUNCH(3)</code> command on the <code>PRINT</code> statement directs
the output to the teletype (rather than a tape punch which would otherwise 
be the default).</p>

<p>This program prints out a table of sine and cosine values for some angles
between 0 and 360 degrees.</p>
<p>The source code for the program makes use of the 
<a href="telecode.html#jtotc">extended mapping</a> from Java system characters 
to telecode characters provided by the simulator to provide better looking 
source code.
In particular both upper- and lowercase characters can be used (though they
are treated identically), semicolons can be used as statement separators (rather than 
apostrophes) and square brackets can be used for array subscripts.
The code also uses the number sign (#) instead of the GB pound sign (&pound;)
for the open string quote, for easier use on non UK keyboards.</p>

&quot;long comma&quot; that was unique to ALGOL 60.

equivalent to a comma!</td></tr>

a redundant <code>FOR I:=0</code> control variable part of the statement.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Line&nbsp;51:</td>
<td>A rather pointless function procedure definition, but it does demonstrate 
some aspects of the language, such as assigning the function result to the

<tr><td valign="top">Line&nbsp;53:</td>
<td>This statement reads two integer values from the tape reader.
The actual values to be read are appended to the source code tape after
the final <code>END</code>.
It is assumed the tape will be left in the reader after the source code 
has been compiled.
When reading integer values the compiler will simply skip any non digit 
characters it encounters, so you can add comments to indicate what the 
numbers mean, as has been done here.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Line&nbsp;60:</td>
<td>The <code>PUNCH(3)</code> statement directs all output to the teletype.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Lines&nbsp;63&nbsp;to&nbsp;67:</td>
<td>These lines use the simulator's <a href="extras.html#random">random number 
device</a> to generate some random numbers (between 0 and 511).
The <code>ELLIOTT(...)</code> statement inserts a single line of machine
code, in this case it reads the random number generator to the accumulator 
and ANDs the value with 511 (i.e. 9 bits) to create the result.
The real Elliott 803 did not have a random number generator.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Lines&nbsp;80&nbsp;and&nbsp;81:</td>

statements that are strictly speaking unnecessary, but I prefer to always
put them in as they are harmless and result in less errors when the program

<p>The QuickSort program is a particularly nice example, since the Quicksort 
algorithm was invented by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._A._R._Hoare">Tony Hoare</a>
and it was the same Tony Hoare who was responsible for much of the 
implementation of the Elliott 803 ALGOL compiler.</p>

<p>This program demonstrates a simple use of the graph plotter to draw
an approximate sine-wave.
The mechanism used to draw lines on the plotter is deliberately done in
a very simple manner, but it seems perfectly adequate for this application.</p>
<p>Note that <code>ELLIOTT()</code> statements are used to insert specific
machine code instructions to drive the plotter.
The plotter had paper that was 11 inches wide and a pen that could be 
moved in steps of 1/100 inch in any of 8 directions using special machine
instructions:</p>

<p>The Elliott ALGOL compiler included a pre-compiled <i>Plotter Package</i> 
that would normally be used to drive the plotter.
This provided a set of procedures that could be used to set the origin, scale
output, draw lines and various other options - including directing the output
of PRINT statements to the plotter to add text and labels to graphs.
The sample program however does not use the plotter package, mostly because I
simply can't remember exactly how it all worked!</p>

<h2 id="contrib">Contributed Programs</h2>
<p>These are some rather more complex example ALGOL programs that have been 
kindly contributed by <a href="mailto:general_factotum@hotmail.co.uk">Bob Firth</a>.
Both these programs do a lot of intensive calculation and both will run very
much faster if the CPU and Core Store windows are minimized and the <i>Real time</i>
option is deselected.</p>
