<h3>Project Aims</h3>
<p>The aim of this project is to produce a simulation of the Elliott 803
computer that is capable of running original 803 programs (provided they
can be made available as system files rather than real paper tapes).
In particular it is an aim to run ALGOL 60 programs using the original
Elliott ALGOL compiler and achieve correct results.</p>
<p>The project has been written in Java to enable it to run easily 
on most systems and the user interface elements have been written as 
simple Java Swing interfaces.
Some elements of the interface such as the 
<a href="operation.html#opcon">operator's console</a> have been made to 
look and work in a manner very similar to the real 803 version (as far as 
the Swing interface allows); other elements such as the 
<a href="operation.html#optape">paper tape readers and punches</a> are 
just simple implementations to allow easy operation and don't look
anything like the real thing.</p>
<p>The simulation can be set to run at a very close approximation to the 
speed of a real 803B complete with authentic console speaker sounds, or can 
be set to run as fast as the implementation allows - which can be useful for 
speeding up tedious operations such as loading the large compiler tapes.</p>
<h3>Notable Omissions</h3>
<p>The following elements of the Elliott 803 are currently not implemented
in this project.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Full Floating Point</b>
<br>The simulation does fully implement all the group 6 floating point 
instructions but it currently does this using a little cheating.  
The Elliott 39-bit floating point values are converted to Java doubles 
and the operation is performed in Java, the resulting Java double is 
then converted back to an Elliott 39-bit float format.
<br>This is a simple and reasonably successful approach (ALGOL programs, for 
example, run correctly), but the resulting numbers are not always absolutely 
identical to those that would be produced by the real 803 hardware - sometimes
there are minor differences in the least significant decimal places.
<br><br></li>
<li><b>Missing Hardware</b>
<br>Some bits of the original hardware are currently missing from the simulation.
It is hoped to add these in the future:
<ul>
<li>Film Handlers (although most of the enjoyment of these was in seeing the real
huge handlers working!).</li>
</ul></li>
