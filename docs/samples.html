<h1>Sample Assembler Programs</h1>
<p>The following sample assembler programs are provided:</p>
<ul compact>
<li><a href="#hello1">Hello World 1</a></li>
<li><a href="#hello2">Hello World 2</a></li>
<li><a href="#charset">Character Set</a></li>
<li><a href="#printer">Tape Printer</a></li>
<li><a href="#random">Random Storage</a></li>
<li><a href="#music">Play Music</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: the sample assembler programs have been written and assembled using a
simple <a href="utilities.html#assembler">assembler utility</a> provided with 
the simulator.
This is similar though not identical to the original 803 assembler.  
In addition they often use one of the special <a href="extras.htlm#control">simulator
control</a> instructions to exit in a clean way.</p>
<p>Some sample programs that can be used with the <a href="algol.html">ALGOL</a>
compiler are also provided and documented separately.</p>

<h2 id="hello1">Hello World 1</h2>
<table frame="box" rules="all" border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td><b>Source Code</b></td>
<td><a href="../samples/assembler/hello1.a1"><samp>samples/assembler/hello1.a1</samp></a></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Program Tape</b></td>
<td><samp>tapes/samples/hello1.tape</samp></td></tr>
</table>
<p>This is a very simple assembler &quot;hello world&quot; program.
It just prints a short message to the output teletype and exits.
It is compiled to a self-triggering tape that can be loaded and run using 
the initial instructions.
This program is used in the <a href="quickstart.html">Quick Start Guide</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hello2">Hello World 2</h2>
<table frame="box" rules="all" border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td><b>Source Code</b></td>
<td><a href="../samples/assembler/hello2.a1"><samp>samples/assembler/hello2.a1</samp></a></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Program Tape</b></td>
<td><samp>tapes/samples/hello2.tape</samp></td></tr>
</table>
<p>This is a minor variation on the <a href="#hello1">Hello World 1</a> sample.
The program is compiled to a binary tape that can be loaded using the initial 
instructions but the tape does not trigger to the entry point.  
This program is loaded to a fixed address starting at location 7.  
As the tape does not &quot;trigger&quot; the initial instructions will try to 
continue to read past the end and the tape will fall out of the reader - this was
fairly normal 803 behaviour!  
When there is no more tape to read the system will show a <b>busy</b> light when
it gets stuck in a read instruction.  
At this point you need to press the <i>Reset</i> key on the console, to clear the
busy condition, and perform a manual jump to the entry point at location 7 - so
set up the instruction <b>40 7 : 00 0</b> on the word generator and then do the 
standard sequence <i>Read</i>, <i>Operate</i>, <i>Normal</i>, <i>Operate</i>.
After this the message should appear in the output teletype.</p>
<p>This program also enters a spin-loop when it finishes, which was fairly standard
803 behaviour, again the <i>Reset</i> key needs to be used to regain operator
control.</p>

<h2 id="charset">Character Set</h2>
<table frame="box" rules="all" border="1" cellpadding="4">

</table>
<p>This program prints the all 64 telecode characters - the 32 letter-shift versions  
and the 32 figure-shift versions - to the output teletype then exits.
This shows all the characters available and also illustrates the use of a 
<b>73</b> instruction to do a procedure call and return.
The program is compiled to a self-triggering tape that can be loaded and run
by the initial instructions.</p>

<h2 id="charset">Tape Printer</h2>
<table frame="box" rules="all" border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td><b>Source Code</b></td>

</table>
<p>This program will print the contents of the tape in Reader 2 to the output 
teletype.
The program is compiled to a self-triggering tape that can be loaded and run
by the initial instructions.
The CPU will enter a &quot;busy&quot; wait if there is no tape in Reader 2, as soon 
as a tape is loaded it should continue and print out the tape contents.</p>
<p>The behaviour is similar to an online version of 
the <a href="utilities.html#tapeprint">TapePrint</a> utility program.</p>

<h2 id="random">Random Storage</h2>
<table frame="box" rules="all" border="1" cellpadding="4">

</table>
<p>This program writes random numbers (from 0 to 3) to random storage locations,
avoiding overwriting the program itself which is loaded into the very top of
store.
The program is compiled to a self-triggering tape that can be loaded and run
by the initial instructions.</p>
<p>The program is intended to illustrate the use of the 
<a href="extras.html#random">random number</a> simulator device
and also shows the <a href="operation.html#opcore">core store window</a>
updating.</p>

</table>
<p>This program attempts to play some music on the console speaker.
It is written in a very simple way and is a little out of tune, but
shows the speaker producing something other than random noise.</p>
<p>The program is compiled to a self-triggering tape that can be loaded and run
by the initial instructions.
After the tape loads it will enter a &quot;sign wait&quot; with a high pitch tone.
Change the value of the top-most sign bit on the console to play the
music!</p>
