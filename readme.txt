Elliott 803 Simulation
======================
This project is a simulation of an Elliott 803B computer from the early
1960s.  The program is written entirely in Java and should therefore
run easily on most systems. 

Full details can be found at:
   The project homepage:  http://elliott803.sourceforge.net
   Latest documentation:  http://elliott803.sourceforge.net/docs
   The download pages:    http://sourceforge.net/projects/elliott803

The simulation is reasonably complete and includes the following
hardware elements:

 - CPU, ALU and FPU
 - Core Store
 - Operator's Console 
 - Paper Tape Readers and Punches
 - Output Teletype
  
A Java Swing GUI interface allows the simulation to be operated in a 
manner very similar to a real Elliott 803 and also provides a 
visualisation of the workings of the machine. 
  
Off-line utility programs are included to:

 - Display and Prepare Paper Tapes
 - Examine System Dumps and Instruction Traces  
  
A selection of sample Elliott 803 programs are included and others can
be written using:

 - A simple assembler for short test programs
 - The original Elliott ALGOL compiler     

Installation and Operation 
--------------------------
The program, sample code and a copy of the latest documentation are 
provided as a single ZIP file archive.  Download the latest package from
the SourceForge download link and unzip to a suitable directory on your
system.

The program can be run by executing the elliott803-n.n.n.jar file.

For further details refer to the "Quick Start" and "Operation" guides in
the documentation.

Future Work
-----------
The following items (and probably more) are currently missing from
the simulation and can hopefully be added in a future release:

 - Sound
 - Film Handlers
 - Plotter output
 - Ability to save and restore machine state between runs
